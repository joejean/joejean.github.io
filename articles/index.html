                            <p>About 4 months ago, I started using some of my free time to help build Labocine.com, an amazing new platform for science cinema. The back-end is written using the PHP framework Codeigniter. Being at its early stage, the site was hosted on one of those traditional hosting providers. And the deployment of new features was done using the traditional ftp approach. After joining the project and as it grew, I decided to host it on a VPS and automate the deployment process....<a href="/articles/automating-the-deployment-of-a-codeigniter-php-website-with-deployer/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>On July 10th, I joined Namshi as a Junior Software Engineer. I was really excited to start my first full time job writing software. Though, I have to confess that I was also a bit afraid and nervous. Fortunately, after just two days working with the team the fear and nervousness went away. In this post, I will share with you some of the things I have learned so far as well as what I love about working in this awesome team....<a href="/articles/my-first-two-weeks-at-namshi/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve my technical skills. And one thing that I hear a lot as advice to software developers is to keep trying new tools and frameworks. So, I have decided to try a couple of languages/frameworks that I either have never used before or have little experience with. The best way for me to do that is by building the same application using those different languages/frameworks....<a href="/articles/learning-new-tools/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>As a programmer I use Stack Overflow a lot. But last week one of my professors asked us to pick one of the Stack Exchange websites that we have never used before and experiment with it by using some of its features. This article is an analysis of my experience with Stack Exchange Expatriates.
Why did I pick Stack Exchange Expatriates? Well, I wanted to pick something non technical as I already have a lot of experiences with technical forums such as Stack Overflow, Hacker News, SubReddit cscareerquestions etc....<a href="/articles/experiment-on-stack-exchange-expatriate/"> Read More</a><p>

At that time Heroku was the best option for me because it offered a free tier and it was relatively easy to use.
