# Implementing Instant, Full-Text Search In Codeigniter, Part 1

Last week I implemented an instant full-text search feature for a client's website written in Codeigniter. In this post, I'm going to show you how to do just that by building a simple film search engine application.

In order to follow along you need to be familiar with PHP, Codeigniter, MYSQL, as well as HTML, and CSS. Codeigniter is a lightweight PHP web framework. In case you are not familiar with it yet, I recommend you first check out their amazing [documentation](http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/) which will help you get up an running with the framework in no time. Our film data will come from a freely available database called `sakila`. You can download it from [MYSQL's website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html).
