Google recently pusblished a new version of their [PageSpeed API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v2/getting-started). I wanted to play around with it a bit. So, I decided to build a page that displays a visualization of the speed of some of the most popular UAE websites. 

I went to [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/AE) in order to gather the data about the most popular websites in the UAE. I also added a few sites that were not on Alexa's list. I used Google charts for the visualization. The code is on my [Github](https://github.com/joejean/Top-Website-Performance-Visualization). I plan to continue improving it. Your feedback and ideas are welcomed. 

## Visualization
You can access the page with the live and interactice visualization [here](/files/general/uae_websites_speed_visualization.html).
