      <description>When I first built my personal website I deployed it to Heroku. At that time Heroku was the best option for me because it offered a free tier and it was relatively easy to use. But one thing I did not like about it was that the application dyno&amp;mdash;the container that handles all the HTTP traffic to the site&amp;mdash; would go to sleep if my website receives no traffic in a 30-minute period.</description>
