                            <p>About 4 months ago, I started using some of my free time to help build Labocine.com, an amazing new platform for science cinema. The back-end is written using the PHP framework Codeigniter. Being at its early stage, the site was hosted on one of those traditional hosting providers. And the deployment of new features was done using the traditional ftp approach. After joining the project and as it grew, I decided to host it on a VPS and automate the deployment process....<a href="/articles/automating-the-deployment-of-a-codeigniter-php-website-with-deployer/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>On July 10th, I joined Namshi as a Junior Software Engineer. I was really excited to start my first full time job writing software. Though, I have to confess that I was also a bit afraid and nervous. Fortunately, after just two days working with the team the fear and nervousness went away. In this post, I will share with you some of the things I have learned so far as well as what I love about working in this awesome team....<a href="/articles/my-first-two-weeks-at-namshi/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>Google recently pusblished a new version of their PageSpeed API. I wanted to play around with it a bit. So, I decided to build a page that displays a visualization of the speed of some of the most popular UAE websites.
I went to Alexa in order to gather the data about the most popular websites in the UAE. I also added a few sites that were not on Alexa&rsquo;s list....<a href="/articles/speed-and-usability-performance-of-top-uae-websites/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>I’m always looking for ways to improve my technical skills. And one thing that I hear a lot as advice to software developers is to keep trying new tools and frameworks. So, I have decided to try a couple of languages/frameworks that I either have never used before or have little experience with. The best way for me to do that is by building the same application using those different languages/frameworks....<a href="/articles/learning-new-tools/"> Read More</a><p>

                            <p>Today I decided to start my day by reading about common anti-patterns in Python and how to fix them. An anti-pattern in the context of programming is a piece of code that solves a problem but that has the potential of having unintended bad consequences.
One of those anti-patterns is the use of an else clause right after a loop without a break statement. As the article explains, the else clause following a loop is only executed when the loop sequence becomes empty....<a href="/articles/else-clause-in-python-loop/"> Read More</a><p>

We started the first day, Monday the 26th of May, with some welcome talks by the RC founders, facilitators and employees. The Recursers from the first batch also gave us some really good advices....<a href="/articles/first-week-at-recurse-center/"> Read More</a><p>
