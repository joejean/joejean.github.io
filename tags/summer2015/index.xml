      <description>This summer I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to be attending the Recurse Center (RC). RC is a 12-week long self-directed retreat for programmers. It is a place one goes to become a better programmer by working on programming projects of one&amp;rsquo;s interest.
We started the first day, Monday the 26th of May, with some welcome talks by the RC founders, facilitators and employees. The Recursers from the first batch also gave us some really good advices.</description>
